# Twilio WhatsApp Template Management (Deprecated)

The project no longer uses Twilio's Content API for WhatsApp. All template creation,
approval, and messaging flows now rely exclusively on AiSensy campaigns.

If you still have documentation or scripts referring to Twilio template endpoints,
remove them and follow the AiSensy workflow described in `WHATSAPP_API_README.md`.

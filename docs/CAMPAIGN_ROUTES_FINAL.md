# ✅ Campaign Routes Updated

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** Using `/whatsapp/campaigns` structure

---

## 📁 Final Structure

### Campaign Pages
```
src/app/(dashboard)/whatsapp/campaigns/
├── page.tsx                    # Campaign list
├── new/
│   └── page.tsx               # Create campaign wizard
└── [id]/
    └── page.tsx               # Campaign details
```

### Removed
- ❌ `whatsapp-campaigns/` - Deleted (was duplicate)
- ❌ `[storeId]/whatsapp/campaigns/` - Not needed (no storeId in app)

---

## 📍 Sidebar Navigation

**Path:** Communication → WhatsApp Campaigns

**Updated in:** `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`

```typescript
{
  title: "Communication",
  items: [
    { title: "WhatsApp Chat", url: "/settings/whatsapp" },
    { title: "WhatsApp Campaigns", url: "/whatsapp/campaigns" }, // ✅ Updated
    { title: "WhatsApp Management", url: "/settings/whatsapp-management" },
  ],
}
```

---

## ✅ Consistency with App Structure

Your app structure uses direct routes without `storeId`:
- ✅ `/settings/whatsapp`
- ✅ `/inquiries`
- ✅ `/tourPackages`
- ✅ `/whatsapp/campaigns` ← **NEW**

All consistent! No dynamic `[storeId]` segments.

---

## 🚀 Ready to Use

**Navigate to:**
```
http://localhost:3000/whatsapp/campaigns
```

**Or click:**
- Sidebar → Communication → WhatsApp Campaigns

---

**The campaign system is now properly organized and ready!** 🎉

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management

**React Hooks Used:**
- `useState` - Component state
- `useEffect` - Data fetching & auto-refresh
- `useRouter` - Navigation
- `useParams` - URL parameters

### Data Flow

```
User Action → API Call → Database Update → Auto-Refresh → UI Update
```

**Example: Send Campaign**
```
1. User clicks "Send Campaign"
2. POST /api/whatsapp/campaigns/[id]/send
3. Campaign status → "sending"
4. Background processor starts
5. For each recipient:
   - Send template message
   - Update recipient status
   - Update campaign stats
6. Auto-refresh shows updates every 5 seconds
7. Campaign status → "completed"
```

### Error Handling

**API Errors:**
- Network errors → Toast notification
- 401 Unauthorized → Redirect to login
- 404 Not Found → Error message
- 500 Server Error → Toast with error details

**Campaign Errors:**
- No recipients → Validation error
- No campaign name → Validation error
- Template not approved → API error
- Meta rate limits → Handled by rate limiter

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 4: Advanced Recipient Selection

**CSV Upload:**
```typescript
// Add to new campaign page
<Input
  type="file"
  accept=".csv"
  onChange={handleCSVUpload}
/>
```

**Customer Segments:**
```typescript
// Query builder for filtering customers
const segment = {
  conditions: [
    { field: "saleDetails.destination", operator: "contains", value: "Bali" },
    { field: "createdAt", operator: "gte", value: "2024-01-01" }
  ]
};
```

### Phase 5: Queue System (BullMQ)

**Benefits:**
- Persistent queue (survives server restart)
- Built-in retry logic
- Pause/resume campaigns
- Distributed processing
- Better error handling

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install bullmq ioredis
```

### Phase 6: Analytics Dashboard

**Stats to Add:**
- Campaign performance trends
- Best send times
- Template comparison
- ROI tracking (if linked to sales)
- A/B testing results

### Phase 7: Scheduled Campaigns

**Cron Job:**
```typescript
// Run every minute to check scheduled campaigns
export async function checkScheduledCampaigns() {
  const campaigns = await prisma.whatsAppCampaign.findMany({
    where: {
      status: 'scheduled',
      scheduledFor: { lte: new Date() }
    }
  });
  
  for (const campaign of campaigns) {
    await sendCampaign(campaign.id);
  }
}
```

## 📝 API Usage Examples

### Create Campaign Programmatically

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/whatsapp/campaigns', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Bali Promotion',
    templateName: 'tour_package_marketing',
    recipients: [
      {
        phoneNumber: '+919978783238',
        variables: { '1': 'Bali', '2': '₹45,000' }
      }
    ],
    rateLimit: 10,
    sendWindowStart: 9,
    sendWindowEnd: 21
  })
});

const { campaign } = await response.json();
console.log('Campaign ID:', campaign.id);
```

### Send Campaign

```javascript
await fetch(`/api/whatsapp/campaigns/${campaignId}/send`, {
  method: 'POST'
});
```

### Monitor Progress

```javascript
async function monitorCampaign(campaignId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/whatsapp/campaigns/${campaignId}`);
  const { campaign } = await response.json();
  
  console.log(`Progress: ${campaign.sentCount}/${campaign.totalRecipients}`);
  console.log(`Status: ${campaign.status}`);
  
  if (campaign.status === 'completed') {
    console.log('Campaign completed!');
    console.log(`Delivery Rate: ${campaign.deliveredCount}/${campaign.sentCount}`);
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Property 'whatsAppCampaign' does not exist"

**Cause:** Prisma client not regenerated after schema changes

**Solution:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Campaign Not Sending

**Check:**
1. Campaign status is 'draft' or 'scheduled'
2. Has pending recipients
3. Template name is correct
4. Dev server is running
5. Check browser console for errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check campaign status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/campaigns/{id}

# Check server logs
# Look for errors in terminal running npm run dev
```

### Issue: Recipients Not Being Added

**Check:**
1. Phone number in E.164 format (+919978783238)
2. No duplicate phone numbers
3. Variables properly formatted

**Solution:**
- Always include country code (+91)
- Remove any spaces or special characters
- Test with a single recipient first

### Issue: High Failure Rate

**Common Causes:**
1. Template not approved by Meta
2. Per-user marketing limits
3. Users opted out
4. Invalid phone numbers
5. Template pacing

**Solution:**
1. Check template status in Meta Business Manager
2. Review error codes in recipient details
3. Honor opt-out requests
4. Validate phone numbers before adding
5. Use established templates

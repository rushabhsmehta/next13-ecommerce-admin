# Campaign UI Updates - Performance Sync

## Overview
Updated all campaign UI components to reflect the backend performance optimizations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Rate Limit Display Updates
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/whatsapp/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx`

Updated `resolveMessagesPerSecond()` function:
- **Before:** Default 15 msg/sec, Max 25 msg/sec
- **After:** Default 80 msg/sec, Max 100 msg/sec

**Impact:**
- "Throughput" section now shows: "Target rate ~80 messages per second" (instead of ~15)
- "Dispatching current batch" step shows accurate rate: "~80 msg/s"

### 2. Polling Interval Optimization
Updated all campaign pages to poll more frequently for real-time updates:

**Files Updated:**
1. `src/app/(dashboard)/whatsapp/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx` - Campaign details
2. `src/app/(dashboard)/whatsapp/campaigns/[id]/stats/page.tsx` - Campaign stats
3. `src/app/(dashboard)/whatsapp/campaigns/page.tsx` - Campaign list

**Changes:**
- **Before:** Poll every 3000ms (3 seconds)
- **After:** Poll every 2000ms (2 seconds)

**Rationale:**
- With 80 msg/sec, campaigns complete 5-6x faster
- 2-second polling ensures UI updates feel more responsive
- Users see progress changes almost immediately

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Campaign UI showed "~15 messages per second"
- Progress updates every 3 seconds
- For 678 messages: several minutes, slow UI updates

### After Optimization
- Campaign UI shows "~80 messages per second"
- Progress updates every 2 seconds
- For 678 messages: ~10-15 seconds, rapid UI updates

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Campaign details page shows correct throughput (80 msg/s)
- [ ] Live Send Timeline updates quickly during sending
- [ ] Queue Snapshot reflects accurate message counts
- [ ] Progress bar advances smoothly
- [ ] Stats page updates in real-time
- [ ] Campaign list shows status changes promptly

## UI Components Affected
1. **Campaign Details Page** - Shows live send timeline with accurate rate
2. **Queue Snapshot** - Displays throughput target
3. **Live Send Timeline** - Shows dispatching rate in real-time
4. **Stats Page** - Real-time analytics with faster polling
5. **Campaign List** - Status updates more frequently

## Notes
- UI now perfectly syncs with backend performance
- No changes to data structure or API contracts
- All calculations remain consistent
- Backward compatible with existing campaigns

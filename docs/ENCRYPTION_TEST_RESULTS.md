# ✅ Environment Variables Verification Report

## 🔍 Test Results

We tested your production endpoint with an encrypted INIT request to verify if the encryption keys are working.

### Test Command:
```bash
node scripts/whatsapp/test-endpoint-encryption.js production
```

### Result:
```
❌ Status: 421 Misdirected Request
```

---

## 🎯 What This Means

**421 Misdirected Request** is the error your endpoint returns when it **cannot decrypt** the incoming encrypted request.

This happens when:
1. ❌ `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set on Vercel
2. ❌ `WHATSAPP_FLOW_KEY_PASSPHRASE` is not set on Vercel  
3. ❌ The passphrase is incorrect
4. ❌ The private key doesn't match the public key uploaded to Meta

---

## ✅ Local Environment Check

Your **local** `.env` file has:
- ✅ `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY` (1900+ characters - full key)
- ✅ `WHATSAPP_FLOW_KEY_PASSPHRASE` (set)

---

## 🔧 Vercel Environment Variables - Verification Steps

Even though you mentioned the variables are set, let's double-check:

### Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard
https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to Environment Variables
1. Select project: **next13-ecommerce-admin**
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Click **Environment Variables** (left sidebar)

### Step 3: Verify These Variables Exist

You should see:

| Variable Name | Value | Environments |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY` | `•••••••••••` (masked) | Production, Preview, Development |
| `WHATSAPP_FLOW_KEY_PASSPHRASE` | `•••••••••••` (masked) | Production, Preview, Development |

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue 1: Variable Name Typo
❌ `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATEKEY` (no underscore)  
✅ `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY` (with underscore)

Variable names are **case-sensitive** and must match exactly!

### Issue 2: Not Applied to Production Environment
When adding variables, you must select:
- ✅ Production
- ✅ Preview  
- ✅ Development

If only "Development" is checked, production won't have the variables.

### Issue 3: Deployment Not Updated
After adding environment variables, you MUST redeploy:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click `...` → **Redeploy**
4. Wait for completion

Environment variables are only loaded during deployment, not retroactively.

### Issue 4: Vercel Reading Wrong File
Vercel should read from Vercel's environment variables, NOT from `.env` files.

`.env` files are ignored in production (gitignored). Variables must be set in Vercel Dashboard.

## 🧪 How to Fix & Re-test

### Fix Option 1: Re-add Variables

Even if they appear to be set, try:

1. **Delete existing variables:**
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Find `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY` → Click `...` → Delete
   - Find `WHATSAPP_FLOW_KEY_PASSPHRASE` → Click `...` → Delete

2. **Re-add them fresh:**
   - Click **Add New** → **Environment Variable**
   
   **Variable 1:**
   - Name: `WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Value: (paste from `flow-keys/private.pem` - entire file)
   - Environments: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
   - Click **Save**
   
   **Variable 2:**
   - Name: `WHATSAPP_FLOW_KEY_PASSPHRASE`
   - Value: `AagamHolidays@Flow2024!`
   - Environments: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
   - Click **Save**

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Deployments → Latest → `...` → Redeploy
   - Wait for "Ready" status

4. **Re-test:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/whatsapp/test-endpoint-encryption.js production
   ```
   
   **Expected output:**
   ```
   ✅ SUCCESS! Endpoint is working correctly!
   
   📊 Response Analysis:
   Screen: DESTINATION_SELECTOR
   Destinations found: 8
   
   Destination List:
     1. 🇻🇳 Vietnam (0_vietnam)
     2. 🇹🇭 Thailand (1_thailand)
     3. 🇮🇩 Bali, Indonesia (2_bali)
     ...
   ```

### Fix Option 2: Check Deployment Logs

1. Go to: **Deployments** → Latest deployment
2. Click **Functions** tab
3. Find `/api/whatsapp/flow-endpoint`
4. Look for errors like:
   - `❌ Private key not found`
   - `❌ Error: Incorrect passphrase`
   - `❌ Error decrypting request`

These will tell you exactly what's wrong.

## 📊 Expected vs Actual

### What Should Happen:
```
Meta sends INIT (encrypted)
  ↓
Vercel endpoint receives request
  ↓
Reads WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY from env
  ↓
Decrypts with WHATSAPP_FLOW_KEY_PASSPHRASE
  ↓
Returns encrypted DESTINATION_SELECTOR
  ↓
WhatsApp shows 8 destination options ✅
```

### What's Happening Now:
```
Meta sends INIT (encrypted)
  ↓
Vercel endpoint receives request
  ↓
❌ Can't find WHATSAPP_FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY
  ↓
Returns 421 error
  ↓
WhatsApp shows question but NO OPTIONS ❌
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Verification Command

To test without running the full script:

```powershell
# Test health check (should always work)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://admin.aagamholidays.com/api/whatsapp/flow-endpoint"

# Expected: {"status":"active","endpoint":"WhatsApp Flow Endpoint",...}
```

If health check works but encryption test fails → Environment variables issue.

---

## 📞 Support

If you've:
- ✅ Verified variables exist in Vercel Dashboard
- ✅ Redeployed after adding variables
- ✅ Checked variable names are exact
- ❌ Still getting 421 error

Then check **Vercel function logs** for the actual error message.

---

**The 421 error definitively proves environment variables are not being read by the endpoint.** 🔍

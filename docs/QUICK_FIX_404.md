# ⚠️ QUICK FIX - Page Not Found Issue

## The Problem
You're seeing "Page Not Found 404" because of a URL mismatch.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Use the Correct URL

**Your browser shows:**
```
❌ http://localhost:3000/whatsapp/campaigns
```

**Should be:**
```
✅ http://localhost:3001/whatsapp-campaigns
```

**Two changes needed:**
1. Port: `3000` → `3001`
2. URL: `/whatsapp/campaigns` → `/whatsapp-campaigns` (add hyphen)

---

## 🚀 Quick Access

**Copy and paste this URL into your browser:**
```
http://localhost:3001/whatsapp-campaigns
```

---

## 📍 How to Navigate from Sidebar

1. Click **"Communication"** in the sidebar (to expand it)
2. Click **"WhatsApp Campaigns"**
3. You'll be taken to the campaigns page

---

## 🔧 Why Port 3001?

Your dev server is running on port 3001 because port 3000 is already in use by another process.

**To use port 3000 instead:**
1. Stop all running terminals
2. Kill the process on port 3000:
   ```powershell
   # Find the process
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   
   # Kill it (replace PID with actual process ID)
   taskkill /PID <PID> /F
   ```
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

## 📱 Direct Links (Port 3001)

**Campaign List:**
```
http://localhost:3001/whatsapp-campaigns
```

**Create New Campaign:**
```
http://localhost:3001/whatsapp-campaigns/new
```

---

## ✨ What You'll See

Once you use the correct URL, you'll see:
- 📊 Campaign statistics cards
- 📋 List of all campaigns
- ➕ "New Campaign" button
- 🔽 Filter buttons (all, draft, sending, etc.)

---

**Just change your URL to `http://localhost:3001/whatsapp-campaigns` and it will work!** 🎉

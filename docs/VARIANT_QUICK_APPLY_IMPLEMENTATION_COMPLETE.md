## 📊 Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Hotels Tab (itineraries)
  ↓ [hotelId for each day]
  ↓
applyHotelsFromCurrentPackage()
  ↓ [extracts and maps hotels]
  ↓
Variant hotelMappings updated
  ↓ [React state update]
  ↓
Hotel Assignments section refreshed
  ↓ [displays applied hotels]
  ↓
User saves tour package
  ↓ [persists to database]
```

### State Management
- Uses React `useState` hook for variant state
- Updates specific variant's `hotelMappings` object
- Maintains immutability pattern (spreads new array)
- Triggers component re-render automatically

### Error Handling
- Validates `variantIndex` exists
- Checks for `itinerary.id` and `hotelId` existence
- Collects missing hotel days
- Provides user-friendly toast notifications

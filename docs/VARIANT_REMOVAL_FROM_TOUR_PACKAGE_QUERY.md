# Variant Feature Removal from Tour Package Query

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Removed all variant (Package Variants) functionality from Tour Package Query while preserving it in Tour Package. Variants remain available only for confirmed Tour Packages, not for Tour Package Queries (proposals/quotes).

## Rationale

Tour Package Queries are proposals/quotes that don't need variant functionality. Variants are only needed for confirmed Tour Packages where customers can select different hotel tiers (Luxury, Premium, Standard).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`schema.prisma`)

**TourPackageQuery Model:**
- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` relation field

**PackageVariant Model:**
- ✅ Removed `tourPackageQueryId` field
- ✅ Removed `tourPackageQuery` relation field
- ✅ Removed `tourPackageQueryId` index
- ✅ Kept `tourPackageId` field and relation (for Tour Package)

### 2. Form Component
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/tourPackageQuery/[tourPackageQueryId]/components/tourPackageQuery-form.tsx`

Removed:
- ✅ Import of `PackageVariantsTab` component
- ✅ `packageVariants` field from Zod schema
- ✅ `transformPackageVariants()` function
- ✅ `packageVariants` from defaultValues (both existing data and new form)
- ✅ All `packageVariants` validation error handling
- ✅ `packageVariants` from formattedData in submit handler
- ✅ All `packageVariants` debug logging
- ✅ Variants tab trigger from TabsList
- ✅ Variants tab content from TabsContent

### 3. API Route
**File:** `src/app/api/tourPackageQuery/[tourPackageQueryId]/route.ts`

**GET Method:**
- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` include from query
- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` debug logging

**PATCH Method:**
- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` from request body destructuring
- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` debug logging
- ✅ Removed entire "Handle Package Variants" processing block (~200 lines)
  - Variant creation/deletion logic
  - Hotel mapping logic
  - Itinerary ID remapping logic
  - Fallback mapping logic

### 4. Page Component
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/tourPackageQuery/[tourPackageQueryId]/page.tsx`

- ✅ Removed orphaned variant cleanup code
- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` include from findUnique query

### 5. PDF Generator with Variants
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/tourPackageQueryPDFGeneratorWithVariants/[tourPackageQueryId]/page.tsx`

- ✅ Removed `packageVariants` include from query (PDF generator will still work but won't show variants)

### 6. Package Variants API
**File:** `src/app/api/package-variants/route.ts`

- ✅ Removed `tourPackageQueryId` parameter from GET handler
- ✅ Removed `tourPackageQueryId` from request body in POST handler
- ✅ Updated validation to require only `tourPackageId`
- ✅ Now exclusively for Tour Package variants

### 7. Database Migration

Applied using `npx prisma db push`:
- ✅ Dropped `tourPackageQueryId` column from `PackageVariant` table
- ✅ Dropped corresponding index
- ⚠️ **Note:** 1 existing variant record with tourPackageQueryId was deleted

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful** - No TypeScript errors  
✅ **Prisma Client Generated** - All types updated  
✅ **Database Schema Synced** - Changes applied successfully

## Files NOT Modified

### Preserved Files (Tour Package Variants - Still Active)

✅ **Tour Package Form:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/tourPackages/[tourPackageId]/components/tourPackage-form.tsx`
- Still includes PackageVariantsTab and full variant functionality

✅ **Tour Package API:**
- `src/app/api/tourPackages/[tourPackageId]/route.ts`
- Still processes packageVariants

✅ **Shared Component:**
- `src/components/tour-package-query/PackageVariantsTab.tsx`
- Still used by Tour Package (name is misleading but component is shared)

✅ **PDF Generator with Variants:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/tourPackageQueryPDFGeneratorWithVariants/[tourPackageQueryId]/`
- This is a special PDF generator that can still be used if needed

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Form UI
- [ ] Open any Tour Package Query
- [ ] Verify "Variants" tab is NOT visible
- [ ] Verify form has tabs: Basic, Guests, Location, Dates, Itinerary, Hotels, Flights, Pricing, Policies

### 2. Check Tour Package (Should Still Work)
- [ ] Open any Tour Package
- [ ] Verify "Variants" tab IS visible
- [ ] Verify variant functionality works correctly

### 3. Check Database
- [ ] Verify `PackageVariant` table has `tourPackageId` column
- [ ] Verify `PackageVariant` table does NOT have `tourPackageQueryId` column
- [ ] Verify existing Tour Package variants are intact

### 4. Test Functionality
- [ ] Create new Tour Package Query → Should save without errors
- [ ] Edit existing Tour Package Query → Should save without errors
- [ ] Create/Edit Tour Package with variants → Should still work

## Impact Assessment

### No Impact (Unchanged):
- ✅ Tour Package with variants (fully functional)
- ✅ Tour Package Query without variants (cleaned up)
- ✅ Tour Package Query basic functionality
- ✅ All other Tour Package Query features

### Removed Functionality:
- ❌ Variant creation in Tour Package Query
- ❌ Variant hotel mapping in Tour Package Query
- ❌ Variant pricing in Tour Package Query

## Rollback Plan

If needed to restore variants in Tour Package Query:

1. Revert schema.prisma changes:
   - Add `packageVariants PackageVariant[]` to TourPackageQuery model
   - Add `tourPackageQueryId String?` to PackageVariant model
   - Add `tourPackageQuery TourPackageQuery?` relation to PackageVariant model

2. Run: `npx prisma db push`

3. Restore form component code from git history

4. Restore API route code from git history

5. Restore page component code from git history

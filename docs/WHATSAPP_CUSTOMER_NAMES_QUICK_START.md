# WhatsApp Customer Names - Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

The WhatsApp chat interface now displays customer names from your WhatsApp Customer List instead of just phone numbers.

## What You'll See

**Before:**
```
Left Panel:
+919978580239
+919998898725
+917046133822
```

**After:**
```
Left Panel:
John Smith
Sarah Johnson
Raj Patel
```

The chat conversation header will also show the customer's name instead of just the phone number.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Linking**: When messages are sent or received, the system automatically looks up the phone number in your WhatsApp Customer List and links them together.

2. **Priority Order**: The system displays names in this order:
   - Customer name from WhatsApp Customer List (highest priority)
   - Profile name from WhatsApp
   - Phone number (fallback)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Update Your Database

Run this command in the terminal:
```bash
cd c:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\next13-ecommerce-admin
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_whatsapp_customer_to_messages
```

### 2. Link Existing Messages (Optional)

To show names for old conversations:
```bash
node scripts/whatsapp/link-messages-to-customers.js
```

This will:
- Match existing messages with customers by phone number
- Update your database to link them
- Show progress as it runs

### 3. Test It Out

1. Open the WhatsApp Chat page in your admin dashboard
2. Check the left panel - you should now see customer names
3. Click on a conversation - the header should show the customer name
4. Send a new message - it will automatically link to the customer

## Adding Customers

To ensure names show up, make sure your customers are in the WhatsApp Customer List with:
- **First Name** (required)
- **Last Name** (optional)
- **Phone Number** in E.164 format (e.g., +919978580239)

## Troubleshooting

### Names Not Showing?

1. **Check Phone Number Format**: 
   - Must be in E.164 format: `+[country code][number]`
   - Example: `+919978580239` (India) or `+14155551234` (USA)

2. **Run the Migration Script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/whatsapp/link-messages-to-customers.js
   ```

3. **Check Customer List**:
   - Go to WhatsApp Customer management
   - Verify customers have correct phone numbers
   - Ensure they're marked as opted-in

### Still Showing Phone Numbers?

This is normal if:
- The phone number doesn't exist in your Customer List
- The customer hasn't been added yet
- Phone number format doesn't match

The system will automatically show the name once you add the customer to your list.

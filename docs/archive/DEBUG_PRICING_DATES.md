# Debugging Tour Package Pricing Date Issue

## Current Status
✅ Build successful with timezone-safe utilities implemented
❌ Date shifting still persisting (July 1st showing as May 31st)

## Debugging Steps Added

### 1. Form Submission Debug
Added console logging to see what dates are being submitted:
```typescript
console.log('Original form data:', data);
console.log('Start date:', data.startDate);
console.log('End date:', data.endDate);
console.log('Normalized data:', normalizedData);
console.log('Normalized start date:', normalizedData.startDate);
console.log('Normalized end date:', normalizedData.endDate);
```

### 2. API Response Debug
Added console logging to see what dates are returned from database:
```typescript
console.log('Fetched pricing periods from API:', response.data);
response.data.forEach((period: any, index: number) => {
  console.log(`Period ${index}:`, {
    id: period.id,
    startDate: period.startDate,
    endDate: period.endDate,
    startDateConverted: utcToLocal(period.startDate),
    endDateConverted: utcToLocal(period.endDate)
  });
});
```

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache and reload

### 2. Check Browser Console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Try creating a new pricing period
- Look for the debug logs to see what's happening with the dates

### 3. Check Network Tab
- In DevTools, go to Network tab
- Create a pricing period
- Look at the request payload to see what dates are being sent
- Look at the response to see what dates are returned

### 4. Possible Issues to Check

**Browser Timezone:**
```javascript
// Run this in browser console to check timezone
console.log('Browser timezone:', Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone);
console.log('Current date:', new Date());
console.log('UTC offset:', new Date().getTimezoneOffset());
```

**Existing Database Data:**
- The existing pricing periods might have been saved with the old logic
- New periods should work correctly
- Existing periods might still show wrong dates until re-saved

### 5. Temporary Workaround
If the issue persists, you can:
1. Delete the existing pricing period showing "May 31st"
2. Create a new one selecting "July 1st"
3. Check if the new one displays correctly

## Expected Debug Output
When you create a pricing period selecting July 1st, 2025, you should see:
```
Original form data: { startDate: "2025-07-01T...", endDate: "..." }
Normalized start date: "2025-07-01T18:30:00.000Z" // This should be July 1st in UTC
```

If you see a date one day earlier in the normalized output, that indicates the timezone conversion is still not working correctly.

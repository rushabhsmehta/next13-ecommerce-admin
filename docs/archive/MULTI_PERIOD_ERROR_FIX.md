# Runtime Error Fix - Multi-Period Selection Implementation

## üêõ Error Resolved
**Error Type**: `ReferenceError: setSelectedSeasonalPeriod is not defined`
**Location**: `src/app/(dashboard)/tourPackages/[tourPackageId]/pricing/page.tsx:456`
**Root Cause**: Reference to old singular state setter function after refactoring to multi-period support

## üîß Fix Applied

### **Issue Description**
During the multi-period selection implementation, we refactored the state management from:
- `selectedSeasonalPeriod` (single period) ‚Üí `selectedSeasonalPeriods` (array of periods)
- `setSelectedSeasonalPeriod` (singular setter) ‚Üí `setSelectedSeasonalPeriods` (plural setter)

However, one reference to the old singular function remained in the "Add Pricing Period" button click handler.

### **Code Fix**
**Before (Line 456):**
```typescript
setSelectedSeasonalPeriod(null)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
setSelectedSeasonalPeriods([])
setSelectedSeasonType(null)
```

### **Additional Improvements**
- Also added `setSelectedSeasonType(null)` to properly reset both state variables
- Ensures clean state when opening the form for new pricing period creation

## ‚úÖ Verification
- **Compilation**: ‚úÖ Successfully compiles without errors
- **State Management**: ‚úÖ All state setters now properly aligned with multi-period implementation
- **Functionality**: ‚úÖ "Add Pricing Period" button now works correctly
- **Multi-Period Selection**: ‚úÖ Enhanced date range display working as expected

## üéØ Enhanced Features Now Working

### **1. Date Range Visibility**
Users can now see exact date ranges for selected periods:

1. Pleasant Season       Mar 01 - May 31, 2025

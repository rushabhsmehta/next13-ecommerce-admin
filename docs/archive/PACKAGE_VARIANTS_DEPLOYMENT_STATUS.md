✅ Mark default variant for display  
✅ Copy hotel assignments between variants  
✅ Full data persistence across sessions  
✅ Backward compatible with existing packages

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
**New Models Created:**
```prisma
model PackageVariant {
  id                  String   @id @default(uuid())
  name                String
  description         String?  @db.Text
  isDefault           Boolean  @default(false)
  sortOrder           Int      @default(0)
  priceModifier       Float    @default(0)
  tourPackageQueryId  String
  tourPackageId       String?
  // Relations...
}

model VariantHotelMapping {
  id                String   @id @default(uuid())
  packageVariantId  String
  itineraryId       String
  hotelId           String
  // Relations...
}
```

**Relations Added:**
- TourPackageQuery → PackageVariant (1:N)
- TourPackage → PackageVariant (1:N)
- PackageVariant → VariantHotelMapping (1:N)
- VariantHotelMapping → Hotel (N:1)
- VariantHotelMapping → Itinerary (N:1)

### API Layer

- `PATCH /api/tourPackageQuery/[id]` - Now saves variants and mappings

**Data Flow:**
```
Client Form 
  ↓ (save)
API PATCH Handler
  ↓ (transaction)
Delete Old Variants
  ↓

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

## 🔒 Data Integrity

### Save Strategy
**Delete and Recreate Approach:**
- Ensures no orphaned records
- Maintains data consistency
- Prevents duplicate mappings
- Clean slate on each save

### Transaction Safety
- Main package transaction completes first
- Variants saved after main transaction
- Variant failure doesn't break main save
- Logged for debugging

### Validation
**Required Fields:**
- Variant name (minimum 1 character)

**Optional Fields:**
- Description
- Price modifier (defaults to 0)
- Is default (defaults to false)
- Hotel selections (can save without hotels)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: TypeScript Errors in VS Code
**Status:** False positive (build succeeds)  
**Cause:** VS Code language server has cached Prisma types  
**Solution:** Ignore or restart VS Code (doesn't affect functionality)  
**Verification:** Production build passes with Exit Code 0

### Issue: Hotels Not Loading
**Solution:** Ensure hotels exist in database with images  
**Check:** GET /api/hotels returns data

### Issue: Variants Not Saving
**Solution:** Check browser console for error logs  
**Debug:** Look for [VARIANT_SAVE_ERROR] messages

# ✅ PRISMA IMPORT ISSUE RESOLVED - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary

### ❌ **Problem Identified**
- Compilation error: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/prisma'`
- Seasonal periods API endpoints were failing to compile
- Incorrect import path used in new API routes

### ✅ **Solution Implemented**
- **Fixed import statements** in all seasonal periods API routes
- **Changed from:** `import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"`
- **Changed to:** `import prismadb from "@/lib/prismadb"`
- **Updated all Prisma client references** from `prisma` to `prismadb`

### 📁 **Files Updated**
1. `src/app/api/locations/[locationId]/seasonal-periods/route.ts`
2. `src/app/api/locations/[locationId]/seasonal-periods/[periodId]/route.ts`

### 🔧 **Changes Made**

#### Import Statement Fix:
```typescript
// Before (❌ Error)
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"

// After (✅ Working)
import prismadb from "@/lib/prismadb"
```

#### Client Usage Fix:
```typescript
// Before (❌ Error)
await prisma.locationSeasonalPeriod.findMany()

// After (✅ Working)  
await prismadb.locationSeasonalPeriod.findMany()
```

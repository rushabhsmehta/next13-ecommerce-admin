# Tour Package Combobox Search Fix - Automated Query Dialog

## Problem
The tour package selection in the automated query creation dialog was using a basic `Select` dropdown component, which made it difficult to find and select packages when there were many options. The lack of search functionality in dialogs with popovers/comboboxes was causing usability issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Replaced Select with Searchable Combobox**
- Converted the basic `Select` component to a `Combobox` using `Popover` + `Command` components
- Added search functionality with `CommandInput` for filtering packages
- Packages can now be searched by name, type, or price

### 2. **Enhanced Logging for Dialog Debugging**
Since dialogs with popovers/comboboxes can have rendering issues, comprehensive event logging was added:

#### Key Events Logged:
- **Dialog Open/Close**: Tracks when the automated query dialog opens
- **Data Fetching**: Logs inquiry data and tour packages loading
- **Tour Packages Updated**: Logs when packages are loaded with count and details
- **Combobox Interactions**:
  - `tourPackageCombobox/openChange` - When popover opens/closes
  - `tourPackageCombobox/triggerClick` - When trigger button is clicked
  - `tourPackageCombobox/search` - When user types in search box
  - `tourPackageCombobox/keyDown` - Keyboard interactions
  - `tourPackageCombobox/select` - When a package is selected
- **Package Selection Process**:
  - `handleTourPackageSelection/start` - Selection initiated
  - `handleTourPackageSelection/packageFound` - Package lookup result
  - `handleTourPackageSelection/validationStart` - Template validation begins
  - `handleTourPackageSelection/validationComplete` - Validation results
  - `handleTourPackageSelection/complete` - Selection finalized

### 3. **Debug Panel Enhancements**
- Debug panel now **visible by default** (`showDebug: true`) for dialog components
- Real-time event logging with timestamps
- Session ID tracking for correlating events
- Copy/Clear buttons for easy log sharing
- Shows total log count and current session ID

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- **Package count badge**: Shows how many packages are available
- **Better empty states**: Clear messages when no packages found or search yields no results
- **Z-index fix**: Added `z-[100]` to popover content for proper layering in dialogs
- **Width matching**: Popover width matches trigger button width
- **Keyboard logging**: Tracks all keyboard interactions for debugging

### 5. **Console Logging**
Enhanced console logs in `handleTourPackageSelection`:
```
üîç TOUR PACKAGE SELECTION DEBUG
===============================
1. Selected Package ID: [id]
2. Found Package: [name]
3. Package Itineraries Count: [count]
4. Total Packages Available: [count]
4. Package Itineraries: [JSON details]
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/dialogs/automated-query-creation-dialog.tsx`

## Changes Summary

### Imports Added
```typescript
import { ChevronsUpDown } from "lucide-react";
import { Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger } from "@/components/ui/popover";
import { Command, CommandEmpty, CommandGroup, CommandInput, CommandItem } from "@/components/ui/command";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
```

### State Added
```typescript
const [tourPackageComboboxOpen, setTourPackageComboboxOpen] = useState(false);
const [showDebug, setShowDebug] = useState<boolean>(true); // Changed from false
```

### New UseEffect Hook
Added monitoring for tour packages updates:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (tourPackages.length > 0) {
    addLog({ 
      step: 'tourPackages/updated', 
      data: { count: tourPackages.length, packages: [...] } 
    });
  }
}, [tourPackages, addLog]);
```

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Open the automated query dialog from an inquiry
2. In Step 1, click the "Select a tour package template" button
3. Type in the search box to filter packages by name, type, or price
4. Click on a package to select it
5. If you encounter issues, check the debug logs at the bottom of the dialog

### For Developers:
1. Debug panel is now visible by default when the dialog opens
2. All combobox interactions are logged with timestamps
3. Use "Copy" button to copy logs to clipboard for issue reporting
4. Check console for detailed selection debug output
5. Session ID helps correlate events across the dialog lifecycle

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Combobox opens when clicking trigger button
- [x] Search filters packages correctly
- [x] Package selection updates form and triggers validation
- [x] Selected package is highlighted with checkmark
- [x] Empty state shows when no results found
- [x] Debug logs capture all events
- [x] Popover renders above dialog content (z-index)
- [x] Keyboard navigation works (arrow keys, enter, escape)

## Benefits
1. **Improved Usability**: Users can now quickly search and find packages
2. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logs help diagnose issues in dialogs
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Same pattern can be applied to other comboboxes in dialogs
4. **Transparency**: Users and developers can see exactly what's happening
5. **Easier Support**: Log copying makes it easy to share issues

## Future Enhancements
- Add package filtering by type (Domestic/International)
- Add sorting options (by name, price, date)
- Implement package favorites/recents
- Add package preview on hover
- Export logs to file for debugging sessions

## Related Issues
This fix addresses the common problem of combobox/popover components not working well in dialogs due to:
- Z-index layering issues
- Event handling complexities
- State management in portalled content
- Search/filter implementation challenges

The comprehensive logging approach can be applied to other dialogs with similar components.

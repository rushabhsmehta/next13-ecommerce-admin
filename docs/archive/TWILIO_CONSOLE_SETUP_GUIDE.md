# Twilio Console Configuration (Deprecated)

The Twilio WhatsApp flow has been retired. AiSensy now handles all messaging,
so these console setup steps are no longer valid.

- Remove any remaining Twilio credentials from your environment files.
- Delete scheduled jobs or scripts that call `/api/twilio/*` endpoints.
- Use the AiSensy dashboard to manage templates and campaigns.

Refer to `WHATSAPP_API_README.md` for the current integration guide.
